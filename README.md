Travelling-Salesmen-Problem-Java
================================

Challenge Description:

Commuters in the bay area who commute to and from South Bay spend on average 2-3 hours of valuable time getting to and from work every day. That's why startups like Mashery, Flurry, New Relic and Glassdoor have called the San Francisco Peninsula their home.

Today, we're visiting some of area's fastest growing startups and would like to find the shortest possible distance to visit each company once starting from the CodeEval offices at 1355 Market Street.

Solving the following challenge means finding the shortest possible route which visits each coordinate once starting from the point 1. You may read more about the Travelling salesman problem

On the map you can see the best route for 6 coordinates. But we've added 4 more for the offices of Mashery, Flurry, New Relic and Glassdoor. So you need to find the best route for 10 coordinates.
